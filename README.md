# EEG-Classification
This repository contains the code for a project for the class ECE 247: Neural Networks and Deep Learning at UCLA. Our project consisted of classifying movement-related EEG data with a variety of models that use CNNs and RNNs. 

Report.pdf contains the final report for the project.
